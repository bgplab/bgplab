# Open-Source BGP Configuration Labs

This repository contains _netlab_ topology files for a series of hands-on labs that will help you master numerous aspects of EBGP,  IBGP, and BGP routing policy configuration on a platform of your choice[^PC]. You can run them on [your laptop](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu-vm/) (including [Apple silicon](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/03/netlab-bgp-apple-silicon.html)), on a [local server](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu/), in the [cloud](https://netlab.tools/install/cloud/), or in a (free) [GitHub codespace](https://bgplabs.net/4-codespaces/).

The labs cover:

**Basic BGP Setup**

* [Configuring and monitoring routing daemons on Cumulus Linux and FRRouting](basic/0-frrouting)

* [Configure BGP for IPv6](basic/4-ipv6)
* [Redistribute IGP Information Into BGP](basic/5-redistribute)

**Protecting BGP Sessions**

* [Protect EBGP sessions](basic/6-protect) with MD5 passwords and TTL protection (GTSM)

* [Dynamic BGP Peers](session/9-dynamic)

**Simple BGP Routing Policies**

* [Use BGP weights](policy/1-weights) to prefer one of the upstream providers
* [Prevent route leaking between upstream providers](policy/2-stop-transit) with an AS-path filter
* [Filter prefixes advertised by your autonomous system](policy/3-prefix) with a prefix list
* [Minimize the size of your BGP table](policy/4-reduce) with inbound filters
* [Implement a consistent AS-wide routing policy](policy/5-local-preference) with BGP local preference.
* [Use MED to Influence Incoming Traffic Flow](policy/6-med)
* [Use AS-Path Prepending to Influence Incoming Traffic Flow](policy/7-prepend)
* [Attach BGP Communities to Outgoing BGP Updates](policy/8-community-attach)
* [Use Outbound Route Filters (ORF) for IP Prefixes](policy/f-orf)
* [Use Disaggregated Prefixes to Select the Primary Link](policy/b-disaggregate)

**Complex BGP Routing Policies**

* [Use BGP Communities in Routing Policies](policy/9-community-use)
* [Using BGP Local Preference in a Complex Routing Policy](policy/a-locpref-route-map)
* [Use BGP Policy Templates](session/7-policy)
* [Resolve BGP Wedgies](policy/e-wedgies)

**Load Balancing**

* [Load Balancing across External BGP Paths](lb/1-ebgp)

* [IBGP Load Balancing with BGP Additional Paths](lb/4-ibgp-add-path)

**Advanced Topics**

* [Use BFD to Speed Up BGP Convergence](basic/7-bfd)
* [BGP route aggregation](basic/8-aggregate)
* [Running EBGP Across a Firewall](basic/e-ebgp-multihop)
* [Reuse a BGP AS Number Across Multiple Sites](session/1-allowas_in)
* [Fix AS-Path in Environments Reusing BGP AS Numbers](session/2-asoverride)
* [Use Multiple AS Numbers on the Same Router](session/3-localas)
* [Remove Private BGP AS Numbers from the AS Path](session/4-removeprivate)
* [Advertise Default Route in BGP](basic/c-default-route)
* [EBGP Sessions over IPv6 LLA Interfaces](basic/d-interface)
* [BGP Route Server in an Internet Exchange Point](session/5-routeserver)
* [Passive BGP Sessions](session/8-passive)

**Challenge Labs**

* [Using Bird BGP Daemon as a BGP Route Reflector](challenge/01-bird-rr)
* [Merge Networks Using Different BGP AS Numbers](challenge/20-merge-as)
* [Stop the Propagation of Configuration Errors](challenge/04-block-fat-fingers/)
* [Minimize the Forwarding Table on BGP Routers](challenge/30-reduce-fib)
* [BGP Graceful Shutdown](challenge/03-graceful-shutdown)

[^PC]: Some assembly required: while the Cumulus Linux VMs/containers used for external BGP speakers are easy to download, you'll have to build a Vagrant box or install a Docker container image for your platform.
