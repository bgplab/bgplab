Still, you can use most of them (potentially with slightly reduced functionality) with any other virtual lab environment or on physical gear. For the rest of this document, we\u2019ll assume you decided to use netlab ; if you want to set up your lab in some other way, read the Manual Setup document. Warning BGP labs work best with netlab release 1.6.4 or later. If you\u2019re using an earlier netlab release, please upgrade with pip3 install --upgrade networklab . Select the Network Devices You Will Work With You can run Cumulus Linux (and FRR) in all netlab -supported virtualization environments (VirtualBox, libvirt, or Docker), and if you want to start practicing BGP with minimum hassle, consider using it for all lab devices. Use FRR on the ARM CPU (for example, Macbooks with Apple silicon ). If you\u2019d like to use a more traditional networking device, use any other netlab -supported device for which we implemented basic BGP configuration as the device to practice with 1 . I recommend Arista cEOS or Nokia SR Linux containers; they are the easiest ones to install and use. Select the Additional Devices in Your Lab The labs heavily rely on external BGP feeds \u2013 preconfigured devices with which your routers exchange routing information. You won\u2019t configure those devices, but you might have to log into them and execute show commands. Use Cumulus Linux on those devices with netlab releases older than 1.6.4. With release 1.6.4 (and later), you can choose any one of these devices for your external BGP feeds 4 : Environment Devices that can be used as external BGP feeds 2 Recommended Containers (clab) Arista EOS, Aruba AOS-CX, Cumulus Linux, FRR, Nokia SR Linux 3 FRR ( frr ) 5 Virtual machines (libvirt) Arista EOS, Aruba AOS-CX, Cisco IOSv, Cisco IOS-XE, Cumulus Linux, FRR Cumulus Linux ( cumulus ) 6 Virtual machines (Virtualbox) Arista EOS, Cisco IOSv, Cisco IOS-XE, Cumulus Linux, FRR Cumulus Linux ( cumulus ) ARM (Apple) CPU FRR containers FRR ( frr ) Tip Several more complex labs require additional configuration on the external routers. That configuration is usually available for Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, and FRR. Each lab description contains specific device requirements section. Consult those if you want to use less-popular devices in your labs. Select the Virtualization Environment Now that you know which network device to use, check which virtualization environment you can use. I would prefer containerlab over libvirt with virtualbox being a distant third, but that\u2019s just me. A gotcha: You can use virtualbox if you want to run the lab devices as virtual machines on your Windows- or MacOS laptop with Intel CPU, but even then, I\u2019d prefer running them in a Ubuntu VM . One more gotcha: your hardware and virtualization software (for example, VirtualBox or VMware Fusion) must support nested virtualization if you want to use libvirt on that Ubuntu VM. You don\u2019t need nested virtualization to run Docker containers unless you\u2019re using the crazy trick we\u2019re forced to use for Aruba AOS-CX, Juniper vMX, or Nokia SR OS \u2013 they\u2019re running as a virtual machine within a container . Software Installation Based on the choices you made, you\u2019ll find the installation instructions in one of these documents: Virtualbox-Based Lab on Windows or MacOS Ubuntu VM Installation on Windows or MacOS Ubuntu Server Installation Running netlab on any other Linux Server Running netlab in a Public Cloud Running netlab on Apple silicon Once you have completed the software installation you have to deal with the stupidities of downloading and installing network device images ( Virtualbox , libvirt , containers ) unless you decided to use Cumulus Linux, FRR, Nokia SR Linux, or Vyos. I would love to simplify the process, but the networking vendors refuse to play along. Even worse, their licenses prohibit me from downloading the images and creating a packaged VM with preinstalled network devices for you 7 . Fortunately, you only have to go through this colossal waste of time once. Setting Up the Labs We finally got to the fun part \u2013 setting up the labs: Select a directory where you want to have the BGP labs Clone the bgplab GitHub repository with git clone https://github.com/bgplab/bgplab.git . GitHub UI gives you other options in the green Code button, including Download ZIP Open the defaults.yml file in the top directory and edit it to set your preferred network device and virtualization environment. For example, I\u2019m using the following settings to run the labs with Arista EOS containers while using FRR as the external BGP feeds: device: eos # Change to your preferred network device provider: clab # Change to virtualbox or libvirt if needed groups: external: device: frr # Change to your preferred external router In a terminal window, change the current directory to one of the lab directories (for example, basic/1-session ), and execute netlab up . Wait for the lab to start and use netlab connect to connect to individual lab devices Have fun. When you\u2019re done, collect the device configurations with netlab collect (if you want to save them) and shut down the lab with netlab down Change the current directory to another lab directory and repeat. Once you run out of lab exercises, create a new one and contribute it with a pull request ;) You will have to run the labs on a device with an x86 CPU (Intel or AMD). \u21a9 You can only use devices supported by bgp.session and bgp.policy netlab plugins as external BGP feeds. \u21a9 You need netlab release 1.6.4-post2 to use Nokia SR Linux as additional routers in more complex labs. To configure Nokia SR Linux, you must also install additional software . \u21a9 If you\u2019d like to use other devices as external BGP feeds and are willing to contribute your changes, please add the support for your devices to bgp.session and bgp.policy plugins. Thank you! \u21a9 An FRR container starts slightly faster than a Cumulus Linux container. Also, the FRR containers are built by the FRR project, while the Cumulus Linux containers came from a hobby project of their former employee. \u21a9 There is no official FRR virtual machine image \u2013 netlab has to download and install FRR on a Ubuntu VM whenever you start an frr node as a virtual machine. Using Cumulus Linux Vagrant box is faster and consumes way less bandwidth. \u21a9 I\u2019m not going to pay a lawyer to read their boilerplate stuff, and I\u2019m definitely not going to rely on my amateur understanding of US copyright law. \u21a9","title":"Installation and Setup"},{"location":"1-setup/#software-installation-and-lab-setup","text":"It\u2019s easiest to use the BGP labs with netlab .

The CLI usually provides show commands to inspect the state of the device and a configuration mode that allows the user to configure the device. Cumulus Linux and FRRouting are different. They are implemented as an application/management layer on top of Linux and use Linux shell as the initial CLI. To configure them, you have to: Use standard Linux tools like ifupdown to configure the interfaces; Edit FRRouting configuration files to start routing protocol daemons Start FRRouting configuration shell from the Linux CLI. The Linux interfaces and IP addresses will be configured automatically if you start the BGP labs with the netlab up command. You will have to start the routing protocol daemons if you plan to use Cumulus Linux or FRRouting as the user routers, and you might have to execute show commands on Cumulus Linux or FRRouting acting as the external routers. You\u2019ll practice both in this lab exercise. Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to basic/0-frrouting Execute netlab up to start a lab with two Cumulus Linux or FRR virtual machines or containers (depending on your lab setup). Tip The lab topology uses Cumulus Linux virtual machines or containers but switches to FRR containers if you\u2019re running the labs on an ARM CPU (for example, on Macbooks using Apple silicon ). Log into the devices ( rtr and x1 ) with the netlab connect command. Start the BGP Daemon Most network devices start routing daemons when you configure them through the configuration CLI or API. FRRouting (the routing daemons used in Cumulus Linux) is different: you have to enable the desired routing daemons in a configuration file and restart the top-level FRRouting process. Tip You can skip this step if you use NVUE CLI to configure routing on Cumulus Linux 5.x \u2013 it automatically enables FRR daemons before configuring them. Warning You cannot restart the top-level FRRouting process in an FRR container. When you use FRRouting containers in your labs, netlab always enables the BGP daemon.

Cumulus Linux and FRR containers run as the root user, and you connect to them as the root user with the docker exec or netlab connect commands. When working with containers, you can start vtysh without using the sudo command. You can execute sudo vtysh as a root user on Cumulus Linux, but not within an FRR container \u2013 the FRR container does not include the sudo command. Long story short: Use sudo vtysh whenever possible to burn it into your muscle memory. Use vtysh if you use FRRouting containers as the lab devices.

Reference Information This lab uses a subset of the 4-router lab topology . The following information might help you if you plan to build custom lab infrastructure: Device Requirements Customer router: use any device supported by the netlab BGP configuration module . External router needs support for default route origination . If you want to use an unsupported device as an external router, remove the bgp.originate attribute from the lab topology.

Configuration Tasks You have to advertise 192.168.42.0/24 \u2013 the IP address space belonging to your organization \u2013 to the upstream providers. BGP never originates IP prefixes without being told to do so. The usual ways to do that are: Redistribution of other routing information sources into BGP \u2013 for example, redistributing directly connected subnets or OSPF routes. You\u2019ll practice that in the Redistribute IGP Information Into BGP lab exercise. Origination of configured prefixes, often using network router configuration command. This approach assumes there\u2019s an exact match in the IP routing table While the first method is usually used within enterprise networks that use BGP as an internal routing protocol or to connect to an MPLS/VPN service, you should have tight control over the prefixes advertised to the public Internet. Please use the second method in this lab exercise. Yet again, there are several ways to add an IP prefix that exactly matches the prefix specified in the network command to the IP routing table: Create a new loopback interface and configure an IP address from the desired prefix on the loopback interface. For example, configure the IP address 192.168.42.1/24 on the Loopback1 interface. Add an IP address from the desired prefix as a secondary IP address on an existing loopback interface 1 . For example, configure the IP address 192.168.42.1/24 as a secondary IP address on the Loopback0 interface. Add a static route pointing to nowhere for the desired IP prefix. For example, add the static route for 192.168.42.0/24 pointing to the null0 interface. Try using this approach in this lab exercise. Warning If your device happens to be fully compliant with RFC 8212 (example: Cisco IOS XR), you\u2019ll have to configure a permit everything outgoing filter on all EBGP neighbors or your device won\u2019t send them anything.

The IPv4 prefixes you want to advertise to EBGP neighbors must be in your router\u2019s BGP table first. A command similar to show ip bgp is thus a good starting point. This is how Arista EOS displays the BGP table: rtr#show ip bgp BGP routing table information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 Route status codes: s - suppressed contributor, * - valid, > - active, E - ECMP head, e - ECMP S - Stale, c - Contributing to ECMP, b - backup, L - labeled-unicast % - Pending BGP convergence Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete RPKI Origin Validation codes: V - valid, I - invalid, U - unknown AS Path Attributes: Or-ID - Originator ID, C-LST - Cluster List, LL Nexthop - Link Local Nexthop Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 0.0.0.0/0 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i * 0.0.0.0/0 10.1.0.6 0 - 100 0 65101 i * > 192.168.42.0/24 - - - - 0 ? * > 192.168.100.0/24 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i * > 192.168.101.0/24 10.1.0.6 0 - 100 0 65101 i However, you must know if your router advertises its prefixes to its EBGP neighbors. Some network devices have a show command that displays prefixes advertised to a neighbor. Here\u2019s how that command works on Arista EOS: rtr#show ip bgp neighbor 10.1.0.2 advertised-routes BGP routing table information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 Route status codes: s - suppressed contributor, * - valid, > - active, E - ECMP head, e - ECMP S - Stale, c - Contributing to ECMP, b - backup, L - labeled-unicast, q - Queued for advertisement % - Pending BGP convergence Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete RPKI Origin Validation codes: V - valid, I - invalid, U - unknown AS Path Attributes: Or-ID - Originator ID, C-LST - Cluster List, LL Nexthop - Link Local Nexthop Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 192.168.42.0/24 10.1.0.1 - - - - 65000 ? * > 192.168.101.0/24 10.1.0.1 - - - - 65000 65101 i Check the BGP table on the remote router to ensure everything is okay.

For example, add the static route for 192.168.42.0/24 pointing to the null0 interface. Try using this approach in this lab exercise.

That makes little sense when using BGP as a generic routing protocol, for example, when connecting your sites to an MPLS/VPN service. In these scenarios, it\u2019s better to redistribute local routing information (connected subnets, static routes, and IGP routes) into the BGP table; you\u2019ll practice the route redistribution approach in this exercise. Your lab has two sites connected to an MPLS/VPN provider. Each site has a WAN edge router and a core router, running OSPF between them. Your WAN edge routers run BGP with the provider edge routers. In this lab exercise, you must establish connectivity between your sites so that the site routers (S1 and S2) can ping each other. Lab Configuration If you\u2019re using netlab, you\u2019ll start with a preconfigured lab \u2013 netlab will configure IP addressing, OSPF routing, and EBGP sessions.

Note: netlab will configure IP addressing, OSPF routing, and EBGP sessions on your routers. If you\u2019re not using netlab , you must manually configure them. Configuration Tasks You have to exchange OSPF routing information between the two sites using BGP. To get that done, you have to: Configure OSPF-to-BGP redistribution on C1 and C2, usually using a command similar to redistribute ospf 1 within the BGP configuration. Configure BGP-to-OSPF redistribution on C1 and C2, usually using a command similar to redistribute bgp 2 within the OSPF configuration. Warning Two-way redistribution between routing protocols could quickly become exceedingly complex. Advertising the default route into the edge routing protocol is often better than redistributing core routes. You should test this alternative as an optional part of the lab exercise. Verification You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019ve installed netlab release 1.8.3 or later and use Cumulus Linux, FRR, or Arista EOS on S1, S2, X1, and X2. The following screenshot shows the validation results before the two-way redistribution was configured: Do manual verification if the netlab validate command fails or you\u2019re using another network operating system on those routers. The local OSPF prefixes you want to advertise to the remote site must be in your router\u2019s BGP table first.

That\u2019s good enough for small, non-redundant networks; in more complex scenarios, you\u2019d want a WAN edge router to advertise a prefix only if it can reach at least some parts of that address space. For example, in this lab exercise, you\u2019ll configure the WAN edge router on Site-1 (R1) to advertise IP prefix 10.42.42.0/24 only if it has at least one more specific prefix in the IP routing table.

Note netlab will configure IP addressing, OSPF routing, and EBGP sessions on your routers. If you\u2019re not using netlab , you must manually configure them. Redistribute OSPF into BGP BGP will summarize (aggregate) only prefixes already in the BGP table. Your BGP tables are currently empty (you have not configured any prefixes to advertise). Redistribute OSPF into BGP on R1 to populate the BGP table with the prefixes from the 10.42.42.0/24 address space as you did in the Redistribute IGP Information Into BGP lab exercise. Note When you configure OSPF-to-BGP redistribution, some network devices redistribute only routes received from other OSPF routers, while other devices also redistribute local subnets on which you\u2019re running OSPF. This implementation difference will not impact our lab exercise but might result in slightly different printouts. After configuring the OSPF-to-BGP redistribution on R1 (running Arista cEOS), the BGP table on R1 contains numerous prefixes learned via OSPF 1 : ce1#show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i * > 10.42.42.16/28 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i * > 10.42.42.128/25 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i R1 advertises all these prefixes to X1, which propagates them to R2. The BGP table on R2 (and the global Internet) thus contains internal prefixes from Site-1 (a bad idea, but we\u2019ll fix it). ce2>show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i * > 10.42.42.16/28 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i * > 10.42.42.128/25 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i Configure BGP Route Aggregation This step is the crux of this lab exercise: using a BGP configuration command similar to aggregate-address , create a summary prefix 10.42.42.0/24 that will be advertised if at least one more specific prefix is in the BGP table. The aggregate BGP prefix should appear in the BGP table on R1: ce1#show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i * > 10.42.42.0/24 - 0 - - 0 i * > 10.42.42.16/28 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i * > 10.42.42.128/25 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i The aggregated prefix is propagated to X1 and R2 (the good part), but R1 still advertises more specific prefixes (the bad part) and a loopback prefix (the ugly part). ce2>show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i * > 10.42.42.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i * > 10.42.42.16/28 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i * > 10.42.42.128/25 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i Suppress More Specific Prefixes Most BGP implementations can suppress more specific prefixes within an aggregate prefix. This functionality is often configured with the summary-only option of the aggregate-address BGP configuration command. To fix the bad part of your current implementation, suppress more specific prefixes of the prefix 10.42.42.0/24 on R1. After configuring the prefix suppression, examine the BGP table on R1. The more specific prefixes should be marked with s (suppressed): ce1#show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i * > 10.42.42.0/24 - 0 - - 0 i *s> 10.42.42.16/28 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i *s> 10.42.42.128/25 10.1.0.6 - - - 0 i The suppressed prefixes should not be visible on R2 (unless you\u2019re dealing with a nasty BGP bug ): ce2>show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i * > 10.42.42.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i Filter Outbound Updates Finally, let\u2019s fix the ugly part \u2013 deploy an outbound filter on the R1-X1 EBGP session that accepts only the prefixes you want to advertise ( 10.42.42.0/24 ) 2 . For more details, see the Filter Advertised Prefixes lab exercise. With the outbound filter in place, the BGP table on R2 should contain only the desired IP prefix assigned to Site-1. Mission Accomplished! ce2>show ip bgp|begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.42.42.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65100 65000 i Final Verification Disable the R1-SW link.

Before filtering BGP updates, R1 should advertise the default route to X1. Configuration Tasks Configure R1 to advertise the default route to X1 using a command similar to neighbor default-originate . Tip Usually, you have to configure the default route advertisement within the address-family configuration.

That\u2019s why we always had to configure the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the BGP neighbors. A few years ago, Cumulus Networks engineers got an interesting idea : IPv6 ICMP messages could be used on an IPv6 interface to find the IPv6 link-local address (LLA) of the peer router 1 , and the remote IPv6 LLA could be used to establish an EBGP session with that router. Throw RFC 8950 into the mix, and you have a solution in which you could specify interfaces on which you want to run EBGP, not the neighbors\u2019 IP addresses ( more details ). That\u2019s what you\u2019ll practice in this lab exercise. Tip This lab focuses on a somewhat advanced trick usually encountered in data centers that use EBGP instead of an IGP. EBGP over IPv6 LLA is rarely used in Service Provider environments. You might want to skip it if you\u2019re just starting your BGP journey. Existing BGP Configuration The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each router advertises an IPv4 prefix. Node/ASN Router ID Advertised prefixes AS65000 rtr 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.1/32 AS65100 x1 10.0.0.10 192.168.100.0/24 AS65101 x2 10.0.0.11 192.168.101.0/24 X1 and X2 expect your router to initiate an EBGP over IPv6 link-local addresses and negotiate IPv4 address family over that session. Tip Your router has an interface with an IPv4 address and an unnumbered IPv4 interface. X1 and X2 have unnumbered IPv4 interfaces ( more details ). EBGP over IPv6 LLA is thus the only way to establish BGP sessions between them. Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to basic/d-interface Execute netlab up ( device requirements , other options ) Log into your device (RTR) with netlab connect rtr and verify its configuration. Configuration Tasks The configuration process is reasonably simple on Cumulus Linux and FRR: Make sure the EBGP interfaces have IPv6 link-local addresses. Configure interface EBGP neighbors with neighbor name interface remote-as asn Add neighbor descriptions and BGP neighbor status logging Activate the EBGP neighbor within the IPv4 address family. Other platforms might have more convoluted requirements. For example, you must enable IPv6 routing and create a BGP peer group on Arista EOS. Warning If your device happens to be fully compliant with RFC 8212 (example: Cisco IOS XR), you\u2019ll have to configure a permit everything incoming- and outgoing filters on all EBGP neighbors.

Configuration Tasks RFC 8326 defines the Graceful Shutdown BGP community that you can use to drain traffic from a link before it\u2019s brought down for maintenance. The routers using the procedures from that RFC should set BGP Local Preference of prefixes carrying the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community to a low value Some vendors (for example, Arista) recognize the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community without extra configuration and set BGP Local Preference to zero. On other devices, you have to create: Configure a route map on X1 that matches the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community and sets BGP Local Preference as low as possible. Apply the route map to all EBGP sessions. Before starting the maintenance process, the customer router (C1) has to: Set the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community on all EBGP updates Set the local preference on all incoming EBGP updates to as low as possible. Some vendors (for example, Arista) implemented BGP maintenance mode that performs those tasks automatically. On other devices, you have to: Configure an outbound route map that sets the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community Configure an inbound route map that sets the BGP local preference to zero Before shutting down the C1-X1 link, apply both route maps to the EBGP session with X1.

Each one is using a different BGP AS number. ORG-1 is running OSPF, ORG-2 is running IS-IS as their IGP. The first physical link between the two networks (PE2-PE3) has been delivered. You decided to use the IPv4 prefix 172.29.42.0/24 on that link. Now, you have to connect the two networks with a minimum disruption of existing network operations: The only change you can make is a new BGP session between PE2 and PE3. Do not advertise the interconnect prefix (172.29.42.0/24) into either IGP. Tip You can change other aspects of device configuration on PE2 and PE3; for example, you\u2019ll have to assign IP addresses to the network interconnect. You cannot change configurations on other routers or redesign the routing protocols (even though that would be the best way to proceed). At the end of the migration project: ORG-1 and ORG-2 must announce all BGP prefixes belonging to the merged network to the external BGP peers. The external BGP peers have AS-path filters in place. ORG-1 AS should not appear in the AS path advertised by routers in ORG-2 and vice versa. As you plan to add more connections between the two networks, you must implement optimal end-to-end routing across the merged network.

That scenario is implausible \u2013 an organization investing in its own IP address space and AS number usually does that to achieve higher resilience of its Internet connectivity, and having a single WAN edge router is not good enough for that. In this lab exercise, you\u2019ll build a more realistic solution: your organization uses two WAN edge routers running BGP with two upstream ISPs. Most organizations want to optimize the use of their (still relatively expensive) WAN links \u2013 you\u2019ll have to ensure that all your routers reach the destinations in ISP-1 via the R1-X1 uplink (and similarly for ISP-2). Existing Lab Configuration When starting the lab with netlab , you\u2019ll get a preconfigured lab with EBGP sessions between the three autonomous systems and OSPF running between R1 and R2. BGP Configuration The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each upstream router advertises an IPv4 prefix; your routers advertise the IPv4 prefix of the LAN subnet connecting them. Node/ASN Router ID Advertised prefixes AS65000 r1 10.0.0.1 10.0.100.0/24 r2 10.0.0.2 10.0.100.0/24 AS65100 x1 192.168.100.1 192.168.100.0/24 AS65101 x2 172.16.101.1 172.16.101.0/24 netlab configures these EBGP sessions when starting the lab; if you\u2019re using some other lab infrastructure, you\u2019ll have to manually configure EBGP neighbors and advertised prefixes.

Warning If you\u2019re not using netlab , you must configure R1 and R2 yourself. Why Do We Need IBGP? Inspect the BGP tables on R1 and R2. They contain the routes received from upstream ISPs but not those received by the other WAN router \u2013 R1 cannot use the R2-X2 uplink to reach ISP-2 (and vice versa for R2). The following printouts contain BGP tables on R1 and R2 (Arista vEOS generated all printouts in this lab exercise): r1>show ip bgp | begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.100.0/24 - - - - 0 i * > 172.16.101.0/24 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 65101 i * > 192.168.100.0/24 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i r2>show ip bgp | begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.100.0/24 - - - - 0 i * > 172.16.101.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65101 i * > 192.168.100.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65101 65100 i The content of the BGP tables on R1 and R2 shouldn\u2019t surprise you; R1 and R2 are exchanging internal routes (using OSPF) but not external routes. We could \u201csolve\u201d the challenge by redistributing external routes into OSPF (hint: don\u2019t do that ), but then we\u2019d lose the BGP information like the AS path the routers need to compare the routes. The only sane way forward is to establish a BGP session between R1 and R2, and because that session is set up between two routers in the same autonomous system, we call it an internal BGP (IBGP) session. Establish IBGP Session Configuration tasks: Configure an IBGP session between the loopback interfaces of R1 and R2 (10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2) using a BGP configuration command similar to neighbor address remote-as 65000 . Tip You\u2019ll find more details in the Configure a Single EBGP Session lab exercise. On some devices, you\u2019ll have to activate the IBGP session within the IPv4 address family Verification: Check the status of the IBGP session with a command similar to show ip bgp summary or show ip bgp neighbors The following printout contains the BGP summary information on R1 after configuring the IBGP session. As you can see, the router tries to establish the IBGP session but fails. r1#show ip bgp summary BGP summary information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance Description Neighbor V AS MsgRcvd MsgSent InQ OutQ Up/Down State PfxRcd PfxAcc r2 10.0.0.2 4 65000 0 0 0 0 00:06:03 Active x1 10.1.0.2 4 65100 2616 3068 0 0 02:10:34 Estab 2 2 Fix the Source IP Address of the IBGP Session BGP uses TCP as the transport protocol, and without further configuration, the TCP session\u2019s source IP address becomes the outgoing interface\u2019s IP address. Attempts to establish an IBGP session using the source IP address of the LAN interface are rejected by the IBGP neighbor as the source IP address in the TCP SYN packet does not match the neighbor IP address configured on the remote router. Configuration task: Configure the source address of the IBGP TCP session with a BGP configuration command similar to neighbor update-source . Note You could also configure the IBGP session between LAN IP addresses to make the lab work, but never do that in a real-life network. You want the IBGP sessions to be stable, and using loopbacks as the endpoints of the TCP sessions (and relying on IGP to figure out how to reach remote loopbacks) is the best way to achieve that goal. Verification: After configuring the source IP address of the IBGP session on R1 and R2, the routers should be able to establish the IBGP session, as illustrated by the following printout: r1#show ip bgp summary BGP summary information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance Description Neighbor V AS MsgRcvd MsgSent InQ OutQ Up/Down State PfxRcd PfxAcc r2 10.0.0.2 4 65000 8 8 0 0 00:00:07 Estab 2 2 x1 10.1.0.2 4 65100 2795 3276 0 0 02:19:28 Estab 2 2 After the IBGP session has been established, R1 and R2 exchange BGP prefixes received from X1 and X2, but the prefixes advertised by R2 are not selected as the best routes by R1 (and vice versa): r1#show ip bgp | begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.100.0/24 - - - - 0 i * 10.0.100.0/24 10.0.0.2 0 - 100 0 i * > 172.16.101.0/24 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 65101 i 172.16.101.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65101 i * > 192.168.100.0/24 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i 192.168.100.0/24 10.1.0.10 0 - 100 0 65101 65100 i Further investigation shows that the IBGP prefixes are not used because they are considered invalid . r1#show ip bgp 172.16.101.0 BGP routing table information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 BGP routing table entry for 172.16.101.0/24 Paths: 2 available 65100 65101 10.1.0.2 from 10.1.0.2 (192.168.100.1) Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, IGP metric 0, weight 0, tag 0 Received 00:07:37 ago, valid, external, best Rx SAFI: Unicast 65101 10.1.0.10 from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, IGP metric -, weight 0, tag 0 Received 00:05:29 ago, invalid, internal Rx SAFI: Unicast Arista EOS is not helpful in this scenario; you have to guess that the underlying root cause is that the BGP next hop is unreachable 1 . Fix the BGP Next Hop of IBGP Prefixes BGP routers do not change the BGP next hop of EBGP routes when advertising them over IBGP \u2013 the BGP next hop of routes in AS 65101 as advertised by R2 to R1 is thus the IP address of X2 on the R2-X1 link ( more details ). R1 does not have a route to that IP subnet in its IP routing table, so it considers the IBGP prefix using that BGP next hop invalid. There are two approaches to make the BGP next hop of IBGP prefixes valid: You can include the external subnets in the IGP process (for example, making them part of the OSPF area). Warning When using this approach, you must make the external subnets passive \u2013 you don\u2019t want to run IGP routing with another autonomous system. You can change the BGP next hop of the prefixes advertised over IBGP to the IP address of the advertising router. We\u2019ll use this approach. Configuration task: Change the BGP next hop of prefixes advertised over IBGP sessions with a BGP configuration command similar to neighbor next-hop-self . Verification: Inspect the BGP tables and IP routing tables on R1 and R2 and verify that: R1 and R2 use BGP prefixes with the shortest AS path as the best BGP routes BGP-derived IP prefixes in the IP routing tables point to the WAN uplinks or the LAN link between R1 and R2.

After starting the lab, you\u2019ll have to configure all the IBGP sessions needed to establish connectivity between the loopback interfaces of PE2 and EXT routers.

Propagate External BGP Routes to PE2 Try to ping the external router ( 172.16.42.42 ) from PE2. You have to check the connectivity between the loopback addresses, so you should use a version of the ping command that specifies the source interface or the source IP address. For example, you must use ping 172.16.42.42 source loop 0 on Arista EOS. Tip You don\u2019t have to worry about the source IP address of the ICMP Echo packets on devices that support unnumbered IPv4 interfaces \u2013 these devices will automatically set the packet\u2019s source IP address to the device\u2019s loopback IP address.

If that\u2019s the case, configure BGP on PE2 to advertise the PE2 loopback interface (see Advertise IPv4 Prefixes to BGP Neighbors for more details). Even better: stop the lab, upgrade netlab , and restart the lab. The lack of BGP routes on PE2 shouldn\u2019t surprise you if you completed the Establish an IBGP Session Between WAN Edge Routers lab exercise \u2013 you already know you need an IBGP session between PE1 and PE2. Configuration task: Configure an IBGP session between the loopback interfaces of PE1 and PE2 3 . Tip The IBGP session is preconfigured on PE1 and should be established as soon as you configure it on PE2. Verification: Check the BGP neighbors and the BGP table on PE2. You should see an established IBGP session between PE1 and PE2 in the BGP summary printout and the BGP route for 172.16.42.0/24 in the BGP table.

It should no longer complain that the network is unreachable but could generate another bit of information on devices that parse and display ICMP error reports.

There are at least four ways to fix the routing in the core of your autonomous system: Redistribute EBGP information into OSPF. That\u2019s dangerous in real-life networks with large BGP tables , and thus, you are not allowed to do it in this lab exercise. Advertise an OSPF default route from PE1. That would solve your immediate problem but wouldn\u2019t result in an actual transit network \u2013 you would run into \u201cexciting\u201d challenges when trying to connect external networks to PE2. This option is thus also off the table. Hide the transit packets from the CORE router using MPLS or IP-over-something tunnels. While the MPLS approach is commonly used to build BGP-free core networks , it\u2019s too complex for this lab exercise 4 . Make the CORE router part of the BGP routing. This is the approach we\u2019ll use. Configuration tasks: Configure BGP with AS number 65000 on the CORE router Configure IBGP sessions between all BGP routers in AS 65000. Tip Due to the IBGP loop avoidance mechanism (never advertise IBGP routes to other IBGP neighbors), you must configure a full mesh of IBGP sessions, adding PE1-CORE and PE2-CORE IBGP sessions. Your lab might work without the PE2-CORE IBGP session but would probably stop working when you connect an EBGP neighbor to PE2 5 . The IBGP session between PE1 and CORE routers is preconfigured on PE1 and should be established as soon as you configure it on the CORE router. You\u2019ll have to configure the PE2-CORE IBGP session on both ends. Verification: Check the BGP neighbors and the BGP table on the CORE router. The router should have two established IBGP sessions and three prefixes in its BGP table: core#show ip bgp sum BGP summary information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance Neighbor V AS MsgRcvd MsgSent InQ OutQ Up/Down State PfxRcd PfxAcc 10.0.0.2 4 65000 14 14 0 0 00:00:10 Estab 2 2 10.0.0.3 4 65000 10 9 0 0 00:00:08 Estab 1 1 core#show ip bgp | begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.2/32 10.0.0.2 0 - 100 0 i * > 10.0.0.3/32 10.0.0.3 0 - 100 0 i * > 172.16.42.0/24 10.0.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i Retry the ping command on PE2.

If that\u2019s the case, configure BGP on PE2 to advertise the PE2 loopback interface (see Advertise IPv4 Prefixes to BGP Neighbors for more details). Even better: stop the lab, upgrade netlab , and restart the lab. The lack of BGP routes on PE2 shouldn\u2019t surprise you if you completed the Establish an IBGP Session Between WAN Edge Routers lab exercise \u2013 you already know you need an IBGP session between PE1 and PE2. Configuration task: Configure an IBGP session between the loopback interfaces of PE1 and PE2 3 . Tip The IBGP session is preconfigured on PE1 and should be established as soon as you configure it on PE2. Verification: Check the BGP neighbors and the BGP table on PE2.

There are at least four ways to fix the routing in the core of your autonomous system: Redistribute EBGP information into OSPF. That\u2019s dangerous in real-life networks with large BGP tables , and thus, you are not allowed to do it in this lab exercise. Advertise an OSPF default route from PE1. That would solve your immediate problem but wouldn\u2019t result in an actual transit network \u2013 you would run into \u201cexciting\u201d challenges when trying to connect external networks to PE2. This option is thus also off the table. Hide the transit packets from the CORE router using MPLS or IP-over-something tunnels. While the MPLS approach is commonly used to build BGP-free core networks , it\u2019s too complex for this lab exercise 4 . Make the CORE router part of the BGP routing. This is the approach we\u2019ll use. Configuration tasks: Configure BGP with AS number 65000 on the CORE router Configure IBGP sessions between all BGP routers in AS 65000. Tip Due to the IBGP loop avoidance mechanism (never advertise IBGP routes to other IBGP neighbors), you must configure a full mesh of IBGP sessions, adding PE1-CORE and PE2-CORE IBGP sessions. Your lab might work without the PE2-CORE IBGP session but would probably stop working when you connect an EBGP neighbor to PE2 5 . The IBGP session between PE1 and CORE routers is preconfigured on PE1 and should be established as soon as you configure it on the CORE router. You\u2019ll have to configure the PE2-CORE IBGP session on both ends. Verification: Check the BGP neighbors and the BGP table on the CORE router.

The original BGP protocol (defined in RFC 4271 ) needed a full mesh of IBGP sessions because it had no attribute that could be used to detect routing loops within an autonomous system (AS path is used between autonomous systems). BGP Route Reflection feature (defined in RFC 4456 ) adds the extra attributes needed for intra-AS loop detection and allows you to build large networks with a hub-and-spoke topology of IBGP sessions. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll practice in this lab exercise. Lab Topology You\u2019ll work with a slightly larger lab containing six routers connected into a leaf-and-spine fabric: The following diagram shows the IBGP sessions needed to distribute routing information (IPv4 prefixes of loopback interfaces) between all routers in your network: During the lab exercise, you\u2019ll remove all IBGP sessions between leaf routers and turn spine routers into BGP route reflectors, resulting in the following IBGP sessions: Tip Please note there\u2019s still an IBGP session between the two spine routers. Removing it would reduce the resiliency of BGP routing in your network. Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure , change directory to ibgp/3-rr You can choose between these lab topologies: topology.yml : 6-router topology with a full mesh of IBGP sessions. Start with netlab up ( device requirements ) hub-spoke.yml : 6-router topology with hub-and-spoke IBGP sessions. Start with netlab up hub-spoke.yml . 4-router.yml : 4-router topology (two leaves, two spines) with hub-and-spoke IBGP sessions and Cumulus Linux running on the leaf routers. Use this topology when you\u2019re low on memory; start it with netlab up 4-router.yml . Tip If you don\u2019t want to use netlab , read the Run the Lab without netlab section. After starting the lab, log into lab devices with netlab connect and verify that netlab correctly configured their IP addresses, OSPF routing, and EBGP sessions.

Configuration Tasks To implement unequal-cost multipathing, you have to: Configure ECMP load balancing for EBGP paths (see the Load Balancing across External BGP Paths exercise for more details). Make both paths toward 10.1.3.0/24 equal from the BGP path selection perspective. Use an inbound route map to remove the MED attribute from incoming updates or set MED in all incoming updates to the same value. Alternatively, some platforms allow you to tweak the BGP route selection algorithm to ignore MED values. Set the BGP link bandwidth extended community on incoming BGP updates received from AS 65100 to influence the unequal-cost multipathing load-balancing ratio. That community is usually set in an inbound route map; some platforms allow you to set the default value per BGP neighbor. Enable BGP UCMP and configure your router to use the BGP link bandwidth community to calculate the relative amount of traffic sent over each link. Tip If you\u2019re not familiar with BGP route maps, do the Use MED to Influence Incoming Traffic Flow and Attach BGP Communities to Outgoing BGP Updates exercises first. Warning You might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft in to tell your router to ask its neighbors to resend their BGP updates after changing the inbound route maps.

Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to lb/3-ibgp Execute netlab up ( device requirements ) Log into your routers and verify that the IP addresses and the EBGP sessions are properly configured. Warning This lab exercise requires netlab release 1.6.4 or later. The Problem Log into the Core router and check its BGP table.

That\u2019s undesirable, as the WE1-X1 path has significantly more bandwidth than the WE2-X2 path. Configuration Tasks The simplest way to change the load balancing ratio on the Core router is to use the BGP Link Bandwidth extended community: Attach the BGP Link Bandwidth community to EBGP paths on WE1 and WE2 1 . The bandwidth on the WE1-X1 links is 10Gbps, and the WE2-X2 link has 4 Gbps. Configure UCMP load balancing on the Core router Configure propagation of extended communities between WE1, WE2, and Core routers 2 . On some devices, you\u2019ll also have to configure the propagation of the BGP Link Bandwidth community. If possible, aggregate the bandwidth on WE1 \u2013 it should advertise a single prefix with BGP Link Bandwidth set to 20 Gbps 3 . Tip You practiced the first two tasks in the EBGP Load Balancing with BGP Link Bandwidth exercise and the third one in the Attach BGP Communities to Outgoing BGP Updates exercise. Verification Log into the Core router and inspect the BGP prefix 10.1.3.0. The paths advertised by WE1 and WE2 should have the BGP Link Bandwidth community. The value advertised by WE1 should be set to 10 or 20 Gbps 4 (try to get it to 20 Gbps); the value advertised by WE2 should be 4 Gbps. core>show ip bgp 10.1.3.0/24 BGP routing table information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 BGP routing table entry for 10.1.3.0/24 Paths: 2 available 65100 10.0.0.3 from 10.0.0.3 (10.0.0.3) Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, IGP metric 20, weight 0, tag 0 Received 00:01:26 ago, valid, internal, ECMP head, ECMP, UCMP, best, ECMP contributor Extended Community: Link-Bandwidth-AS:65000:500.0 MBps Rx SAFI: Unicast 65100 10.0.0.2 from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, IGP metric 20, weight 0, tag 0 Received 00:00:27 ago, valid, internal, ECMP, UCMP, ECMP contributor Extended Community: Link-Bandwidth-AS:65000:2.5 GBps Rx SAFI: Unicast Check the prefix 10.1.3.0/24 in the IP routing table.

In this lab, you\u2019ll modify your BGP configuration to ensure your router always prefers routes advertised by X1 (ISP-1). Existing BGP Configuration The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each autonomous system advertises an IPv4 prefix.

Note: netlab will configure IP addressing, EBGP sessions, and BGP prefix advertisements on your router. If you\u2019re not using netlab , continue with the configuration you made during the previous exercise . Configuration Tasks You want your device to prefer routes advertised by X1 over those by X2. For example, the route for X2\u2019s loopback interface should use X1 as the next hop. Many BGP implementations use a mechanism called weight (usually applied per neighbor) to prefer routes advertised by one of the BGP peers. If your device supports BGP weights , use them to prefer routes advertised by X1. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to use BGP local preference to achieve the same result. Warning Applying routing policy parameters to BGP neighbors doesn\u2019t necessarily change the BGP table as the new parameters might be evaluated only on new incoming updates \u2013 you might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft in to tell your router to ask its neighbors to resend their BGP updates. Verification You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019ve installed netlab release 1.8.3 or later and use Cumulus Linux, FRR, or Arista EOS on your router. The validation tests check: The state of the EBGP session between RTR and X1/X2. Whether RTR receives the prefix from X2 (192.168.101.0/24). Whether RTR uses X1 as the next hop for the prefix advertised by X2. This is the printout you could get when trying to validate an incomplete solution: You can also examine the BGP table on your router to verify that the routes advertised by X1 (next hop: 10.1.0.2) are the best (active) routes.

Tip You could also use a command similar to show ip bgp show ip bgp neighbors neighbor-ip advertised-routes if it\u2019s available on your device to check what you\u2019re advertising to an individual neighbor. Existing BGP Configuration The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each autonomous system advertises one loopback address and another IPv4 prefix. Upstream routers (x1, x2) also advertise the default route to your router (rtr). Node/ASN Router ID Advertised prefixes AS65000 rtr 10.0.0.1 192.168.42.0/24 10.0.0.1/32 AS65100 x1 10.0.0.10 192.168.100.0/24 AS65101 x2 10.0.0.11 192.168.101.0/24 Your router has these EBGP neighbors. netlab configures them automatically; if you\u2019re using some other lab infrastructure, you\u2019ll have to configure EBGP neighbors and advertised prefixes manually.

Note: netlab will configure IP addressing, EBGP sessions, and BGP prefix advertisements on your router. If you\u2019re not using netlab , continue with the configuration you made during the previous exercise . Configuration Tasks You must filter BGP prefixes sent to X1 and X2 and advertise only the 192.168.42.0/24 prefix. Most BGP implementations support prefix lists that match IP prefixes and subnet masks; you should match both to ensure you\u2019re not advertising more specific prefixes to your EBGP neighbors. On some BGP implementations (for example, Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cumulus Linux, FRR, Arista EOS), you can apply a prefix list as an inbound or outbound filter on a BGP neighbor. Some other implementations (for example, Arista EOS) might require a more convoluted approach using a route map as an intermediate step: After configuring the prefix list , create a route map that permits BGP prefixes matching your prefix list . Apply that route map as an outbound filter to all EBGP neighbors. Warning Applying filters to BGP neighbors doesn\u2019t necessarily trigger new updates \u2013 you might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft out to tell your router to recalculate and resend BGP prefixes from its BGP table to its neighbors. Verification You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019ve installed netlab release 1.8.3 or later and use Cumulus Linux, FRR, or Arista EOS on X1 and X2. The validation tests check: The state of the EBGP session between RTR and X1/X2. Whether RTR advertises the expected IPv4 prefix (192.168.42.0/24). Whether RTR advertises its loopback IPv4 prefix (it should not). This is the printout you could get when trying to validate an incomplete solution: You can also examine the BGP table on X1 and X2 to verify that your router advertises only a single IPv4 prefix. This is the printout you should get on X1: $ netlab connect --show ip bgp neighbor 10.1.0.1 routes BGP table version is 8, local router ID is 10.0.0.10, vrf id 0 Default local pref 100, local AS 65100 Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath, i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed Nexthop codes: @NNN nexthop's vrf id, < announce-nh-self Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete Network Next Hop Metric LocPrf Weight Path *> 192.168.42.0/24 10.1.0.1 0 65000 ?

The following information might help you if you plan to build custom lab infrastructure: Device Requirements Customer router: use any device supported by the netlab BGP configuration module . External routers need support for default route origination and change of BGP local preference . If you want to use an unsupported device as an external router, remove the bgp.originate and bgp.locpref attributes from the lab topology. You can do automated lab validation with Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, or FRR running on external routers. Automated lab validation requires netlab release 1.8.3 or higher.

That worked well because you had both links attached to the same router. Now, imagine that you have a redundant design with two routers and want to prefer the C1-X1 link over the slower C2-X2 link. You could use BGP weights to get the job done, but as weights aren\u2019t a BGP attribute and thus aren\u2019t propagated between routers, you\u2019d have to apply them to all BGP sessions on C1 and C2. There\u2019s a better way: BGP has the local preference attribute that works like weights but gets propagated across IBGP sessions. In this lab, you\u2019ll use BGP local preference to ensure all BGP routers in your network prefer routes received over the C1-X1 link. Initial Router Configurations The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each autonomous system advertises an IPv4 prefix.

Note: netlab will configure IP addressing, OSPF, BGP, IBGP sessions, EBGP sessions, and BGP prefix advertisements on your routers. You\u2019ll have to manually configure your routers if you\u2019re not using netlab . Using BGP Local Preference The Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4) RFC (RFC 4271) defines the LOCAL_PREF attribute and mandates that: All IBGP update messages contain the LOCAL_PREF attribute. A BGP speaker never uses the LOCAL_PREF attribute on EBGP updates. The LOCAL_PREF attribute influences the selection of BGP best paths (higher local preference is better). The RFC does not specify how a router sets the BGP local preference or how it influences the BGP best path selection. Most BGP implementations use these defaults to interoperate with older devices: The default value of the LOCAL_PREF attribute that a router adds to EBGP routes before advertising them over IBGP sessions is 100. LOCAL_PREF is considered very early in the BGP best path selection process (before AS path length). This behavior makes LOCAL_PREF an ideal attribute when implementing a consistent BGP path selection across a whole autonomous system. We\u2019ll use the above behavior to implement a straightforward routing policy: Set the default local preference on C1 to 200 (making it better than the built-in default value) Set the default local preference on C2 to 50 (making it worse than the built-in default). Some BGP implementations allow you to change the default local preference value with a configuration command similar to bgp default local-preference . If your implementation does not support changing the default LOCAL_PREF value, you\u2019ll have to use a routing policy (often called a route-map ) attached to a BGP neighbor to modify it. Tip If you\u2019re using a network device that cannot change the default LOCAL_PREF value (example: Arista EOS), then you\u2019re probably already familiar with route maps. You might have been using them in the Filter Transit Routes or Filter Advertised Prefixes exercises. Warning Applying routing policy parameters to BGP neighbors doesn\u2019t necessarily change the BGP table, as the new routing policy might be evaluated only on new incoming updates. You might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft in to tell your router to ask its neighbors to resend their BGP updates.

The distinction between the two paths is small enough for MED to work. Using BGP Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED) The Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4) RFC (RFC 4271) defines the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute as an optional attribute that is intended to be used on external (inter-AS) links to discriminate among multiple exit or entry points to the same neighboring AS. The first limitation of MED is that it can only influence incoming traffic flow if your network connects to a single upstream network. RFC 4271 also defines how to use MED: \u201c All other factors being equal, the exit point with the lower metric SHOULD be preferred. \u201d MED is a weak metric that is considered at the end of the BGP path selection process. You can use it to influence incoming traffic only if the upstream network uses no other routing policy. Finally, RFC 4271 defines MED propagation rules: MED can be used on EBGP sessions. If received over EBGP, the MED attribute MAY be propagated over IBGP to other BGP speakers within the same AS. The MED attribute received from a neighboring AS MUST NOT be propagated to other neighboring ASes. We\u2019ll use the above behavior to implement a straightforward routing policy: Set the MED on routes advertised from C1 to X1 to 50 Set the MED on routes advertised from C2 to X2 to 100 (remember: higher MED is worse). You will probably have to configure a routing policy (often called a route-map ) on C1 and C2 to change the MED and then apply the routing policy as the outbound policy on the EBGP neighbors. Warning Applying routing policy parameters to BGP neighbors doesn\u2019t necessarily change the BGP table, as the new routing policy might be evaluated only on new incoming updates. You might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft to tell your routers to resend their BGP updates.

The following information might help you if you plan to build custom lab infrastructure: Device Requirements Customer routers: use any device supported by the netlab BGP and OSPF configuration modules . External routers must be supported by the netlab BGP and OSPF configuration modules . They also need support for default route origination . You can do automated lab validation with Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, or FRR running on external routers. Automated lab validation requires netlab release 1.8.3 or higher. If you want to use a device that is not supported by the bgp.session plugin as an external router, remove the bgp.originate attributes from the lab topology.

The first limitation of MED is that it can only influence incoming traffic flow if your network connects to a single upstream network. RFC 4271 also defines how to use MED: \u201c All other factors being equal, the exit point with the lower metric SHOULD be preferred. \u201d MED is a weak metric that is considered at the end of the BGP path selection process. You can use it to influence incoming traffic only if the upstream network uses no other routing policy. Finally, RFC 4271 defines MED propagation rules: MED can be used on EBGP sessions. If received over EBGP, the MED attribute MAY be propagated over IBGP to other BGP speakers within the same AS. The MED attribute received from a neighboring AS MUST NOT be propagated to other neighboring ASes. We\u2019ll use the above behavior to implement a straightforward routing policy: Set the MED on routes advertised from C1 to X1 to 50 Set the MED on routes advertised from C2 to X2 to 100 (remember: higher MED is worse).

As X2 selects the best path based on its AS-path length, you\u2019ll artificially increase the length of the AS-path in the updates your router sends to X2. To do that, you\u2019ll have to: Create a simple routing policy (often called a route map ) Configure AS-path prepending in that routing policy. The AS-path X2 receives from X1 has two AS numbers; you\u2019ll have to prepend your AS number at least twice to ensure the direct path is worse than the path X2-X1-RTR. Apply the routing policy to the outgoing updates sent from your router to X2. Warning Some devices allow you to configure either the number of times they prepend your AS number to the AS path or the content of the AS path. Make sure you won\u2019t prepend AS 2 to the AS path. While you can prepend any AS number to the AS path (assuming your device allows you to specify the content of the AS path), never prepend AS numbers other than your own. Applying routing policy parameters to BGP neighbors doesn\u2019t necessarily change their BGP tables; your router might evaluate the new parameters only when sending new updates. You might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft out to tell your router to resend the BGP updates to its neighbors.

Sometimes, more than that is needed, and in this lab exercise, you\u2019ll have to deal with a scenario in which a Service Provider routing policy interferes strongly with your intentions. You have two sites. One is connected to two Service Providers (ISP-1 and ISP-2), and the other has only one uplink (to ISP-2). The link from Site-1 to ISP-1 is significantly faster than the alternate link, and you\u2019d like to use it exclusively. The traffic from Site-2 to Site-1 should therefore flow through ISP-2 and ISP-1 (C2\u2192X2\u2192X1\u2192C1) In this lab, you\u2019ll try to influence the Service Provider route selection with AS path prepending and use BGP communities to tell them what changes you\u2019d like them to make to their routing policy. Initial Router Configurations The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each autonomous system advertises an IPv4 prefix. Node/ASN Router ID Advertised prefixes AS65000 c1 10.0.0.1 192.168.42.0/24 AS65001 c2 10.0.0.2 192.168.37.0/24 AS65207 x1 10.0.0.10 172.17.207.0/24 AS65304 x2 10.0.0.11 172.23.4.0/24 Your routers have these BGP neighbors: Node Router ID / Neighbor Router AS/ Neighbor AS Neighbor IPv4 c1 10.0.0.1 65000 x1 65207 10.1.0.2 x2 65304 10.1.0.6 c2 10.0.0.2 65001 x2 65304 10.1.0.14 Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to policy/8-community-attach Execute netlab up ( device requirements ). You can also deploy the lab on some other lab infrastructure . Log into your devices (C1 and C2) with netlab connect and verify their configurations. Note: netlab will configure IP addressing, BGP, EBGP sessions, and BGP prefix advertisements on your routers. If you\u2019re not using netlab , you must configure your routers manually. Warning This lab requires additional configuration on X2. That configuration is currently available only for Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, and FRR \u2013 you have to use one of those devices as the external BGP router(s). Default Traffic Flow After starting the lab, log into C2 and examine its BGP table, looking for prefixes advertised by C1. You should get a printout similar to this one (generated on Arista cEOS) 1 : c2>show ip bgp | include 192.168.42.0 * > 192.168.42.0/24 10.1.0.14 0 - 100 0 65304 65000 ? As you can see, X2 decided to reach AS 65100 over the direct link. Let\u2019s fix that with AS path prepending. Configure AS Path Prepending X2 might select the path through X1 as the best path toward Site-1 (AS 65100) if you inject enough copies of your AS number into the BGP updates C1 sends to X2. Following the procedure outlined in the Use AS-Path Prepending to Influence Incoming Traffic Flow exercise, extend the AS path of the prefixes C1 sends to X2. If that doesn\u2019t work, prepend more copies of your AS to the AS path. Eventually, you\u2019ll figure out that no amount of prepending fixes the problem. X2 stubbornly uses the direct path to Site-1 (X2-C1) even if you prepend many copies of 65000 to the AS path. Here\u2019s the relevant printout from C2: c2>show ip bgp | include 192.168.42.0 * > 192.168.42.0/24 10.1.0.14 0 - 100 0 65304 65000 65000 65000 65000 65000 65000 65000 65000 ? BGP Communities to the Rescue It\u2019s time to give up and give ISP-2 a call. After enjoying the on-hold music for too long and going through too many escalation steps, you might find someone who understands what you\u2019re trying to do, pointing you to an online document describing how ISP-2 uses BGP communities. That document might contain a description along these lines 2 : All customer routes received by ISP-2 are assigned a local preference 200. Customers can alter this local preference using the following BGP communities: Community Local Pref Effect 65304:102 190 Used for customer backup when multi-homed to ISP-2 65304:101 100 Sets local preference equal to transit routes 65304:100 50 Lowest possible value. Used for backup when multi-homed to multiple providers It looks like your woes could be fixed by using community 65304:100. Here\u2019s what you have to do: You already created a routing policy on C1 to implement AS path prepending. If you skipped that step, create a new routing policy (often called a route map ) on C1. You have already used routing policies in previous lab exercises and should be familiar with them. In the routing policy, set the BGP community to 65304:100 Attach the routing policy to outgoing updates C1 sends to X2. If needed, configure BGP community propagation on C1 with a BGP configuration command similar to neighbor address send-community . Warning Many BGP implementations strip BGP communities from outgoing BGP updates by default. Your routing policy might be perfect, but it will only affect the EBGP updates if you configure BGP community propagation. Even worse, if you use a command like show ip bgp neighbor address advertised-routes prefix , it might not show the BGP community 3 , leading you to the conclusion that your routing policy might be broken. Applying routing policy parameters to BGP neighbors doesn\u2019t necessarily change the BGP table, as the new routing policy might be evaluated only on new incoming updates. You might have to use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft to tell your router to resend BGP updates to its neighbors. Verification You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019ve installed netlab release 1.8.3 or later and use Cumulus Linux, FRR, or Arista EOS on X1 and X2. The validation tests check: The state of the EBGP session between RTR and X1/X2. Whether C1 is advertising its IPv4 prefix Whether C1 attaches the expected community to the EBGP update sent to X2 Whether X2 lowers the local preference of EBGP path advertised by C1 Whether X2 prefers the transit path (X2-X1-C1) over the direct path (X2-C1).

You could use the simple show ip bgp command and sift through the printout, or use printout filters matching on the next hop ( 10.1.0.10 ), or display routes from a specific neighbor (assuming your device supports that) 2 .

In this lab, you\u2019ll practice a more realistic scenario in which you get the same BGP AS number for all sites. Existing BGP Configuration The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers.

That\u2019s what you\u2019ll accomplish in this lab exercise \u2013 you\u2019ll configure the Provider Edge (PE) routers to replace the customer AS number with the provider AS number.

Note: netlab will configure IP addressing, OSPF routing, BGP sessions, and BGP prefix advertisements on all routers. You must manually configure your routers if you\u2019re not using netlab . Warning Some BGP implementations do not support the AS override functionality. For example, it\u2019s not available on Arista EOS. The Problem Assuming your routers are configured correctly, you should see the customer prefixes in the BGP table on the PE routers. For example, this is how the BGP table looks on PE1 running Arista EOS: pe1>show ip bgp | begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 192.168.10.0/24 10.1.0.1 0 - 100 0 65000 i * > 192.168.11.0/24 10.0.0.2 0 - 100 0 65000 i However, the customer routers do not accept the prefixes advertised by other customer sites because the local AS number appears in the AS path.

Configuration Tasks Configuring BGP route server clients is easy (assuming your device supports the BGP route server functionality) and usually takes a single command similar to neighbor route-server-client configured either in the BGP routing process or within an address family: On RS, configure ISP1, ISP2, and ISP3 as route server clients. After configuring the route server clients, the route server sends EBGP updates without its AS number in the AS path. Most BGP implementations reject such updates as the first AS number in the AS path should be the neighbor\u2019s AS number. You have to turn off that check with a command similar to no neighbor enforce-first-as : On ISP1, turn off the first AS check on the EBGP session with RS (it\u2019s already turned off on ISP2 and ISP3). Warning After configuring RS and ISP1, you might have to resend the EBGP updates from RS. Use a command similar to clear ip bgp * soft or clear ip bgp * .

Whether the EBGP updates from RS contain the unmodified AS path. Whether ISP1 accepts EBGP updates from RS (we have to use a ping command to check that). For example, this is the result you\u2019d get if you ran the validation test before performing the configuration tasks: If the netlab validate command fails or you\u2019re using another network operating system on the ISP routers, check the state of the BGP table on ISP1.

Define two session templates on S1 and S2: ibgp : Regular IBGP peers (other route reflectors). They share the update source, the AS number, and the BGP community propagation settings. rr-client : Route reflector clients. They share the ibgp parameters and the route-reflector-client settings. Tip Some BGP implementations support hierarchical templates with inheritance. If you\u2019re using such an implementation, define the \u200crr-client template as a child template of the ibgp\u200c template. Some BGP implementations have \u200csession templates that specify the parameters of the BGP TCP session (update source, remote AS) and \u200cpolicy templates that specify all parameters that can be applied to an address family (BGP community propagation, route reflector clients). You might have to create both templates to get the job done. After creating the BGP templates, change the BGP configuration on S1 and S2 to use the BGP templates: Remove all neighbor parameters from the IBGP neighbors Apply appropriate BGP templates or peer groups to the IBGP neighbors.

Now imagine applying that set of settings to dozens of neighbors you have at an Internet Exchange Point (or to hundreds of customer connections) while making sure the changes in your policy are consistently applied to every neighbor. While network automation is the obvious answer to the above challenge, you might find BGP policy templates (or BGP peer groups ) helpful. They allow you to group all relevant BGP settings into a single object and apply them as a group to a BGP neighbor. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll practice in this lab exercise. Tip This lab exercise uses AS-path filters, prefix filters, and BGP communities. Before starting this one, complete the routing policies lab exercises. Existing BGP Configuration The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each router advertises one or more IPv4 prefixes. Node/ASN Router ID Advertised prefixes AS65000 rtr 10.0.0.1 192.168.42.0/24 10.0.0.1/32 AS65100 x1 10.0.0.10 192.168.100.1/24 10.0.0.10/32 AS65101 x2 10.0.0.11 192.168.101.1/24 10.0.0.11/32 Your router has these EBGP neighbors. netlab configures them automatically; if you\u2019re using some other lab infrastructure, you\u2019ll have to manually configure EBGP neighbors and advertised prefixes. Node Neighbor Neighbor AS Neighbor IPv4 rtr x1 65100 10.1.0.2 x2 65101 10.1.0.6 Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to session/7-policy Execute netlab up ( device requirements , other options ) Log into your router (RTR) with the netlab connect rtr command and verify that the IP addresses and the EBGP sessions are properly configured. The Problem The neighboring autonomous systems advertise too specific prefixes to your router, and your current configuration is no better. This is the current BGP table of your router as displayed on an Arista cEOS container: rtr>show ip bgp | begin Network Network Next Hop Metric AIGP LocPref Weight Path * > 10.0.0.1/32 - - - - 0 i * > 10.0.0.10/32 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i * > 10.0.0.11/32 10.1.0.6 0 - 100 0 65101 i * > 192.168.42.0/24 - - - - 0 ? * > 192.168.100.0/24 10.1.0.2 0 - 100 0 65100 i * > 192.168.101.0/24 10.1.0.6 0 - 100 0 65101 i You\u2019ll have to deploy input and output filters to remove the unwanted prefixes, and you\u2019ll have to apply them to all misbehaving neighbors \u2013 an ideal use case for BGP policy templates. Configuration Steps You\u2019ll have to configure the BGP route filters before getting to the crux of this exercise. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem: you already did that in the Filter Advertised Prefixes and Minimize the Size of Your BGP Table lab exercises. To make things more interesting: Attach BGP community 65000:200 to BGP prefixes received from X1 and X2 Attach BGP community 65000:300 to local prefixes. 1 Tip You did something similar in the Attach BGP Communities to Outgoing BGP Updates lab exercise. Once you have configured the necessary route filters: Create a BGP policy template (some implementations might call them peer groups ). Attach the route filters to the policy template. Attach the policy template to all EBGP neighbors. Resend the BGP updates to the EBGP neighbors with soft inbound and outbound resets of the EBGP sessions. Tip Some BGP implementations (for example, Cisco IOS) have session templates that control the parameters of a BGP session (source interface, MD5 password) and policy templates that control the processing of inbound- and outbound BGP updates. You usually apply session templates to BGP neighbors at the routing protocol level and policy templates at the address family level. Other BGP implementations (for example, Arista EOS) have just the BGP \u200cpeer groups . You can use them to apply \u200csession and \u200cpolicy parameters to BGP neighbors, often at the routing protocol level. Sometimes, you must apply the same peer groups at the address family level to attach the routing filters to BGP neighbors. Verification Inspect the BGP table on your router.

Fortunately, most BGP implementations support dynamic peers ; when configuring them on a BGP router, it accepts any incoming TCP session on port 179 as long as it matches an IP prefix, an IP access-control list, or a prefix list. Warning When deployed incorrectly, dynamic BGP peers could become a huge security risk.

Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to session/9-dynamic Execute netlab up ( device requirements ) Log into the Hub router with the netlab connect hub command and verify its IP addresses and OSPF neighbors. Configuration Tasks Configuring dynamic BGP neighbors is usually a two-step process: Configure a peer group to define the dynamic neighbor\u2019s characteristics. In this lab, you\u2019ll have to define two peer groups, one for IBGP sessions and another one for EBGP sessions. Tip Revisit: Establish an IBGP Session lab if you have a problem configuring IBGP sessions. BGP Session Templates lab if you\u2019re struggling with peer groups. Also, you might have to activate the peer groups for the IPv4 address family. Configure the BGP router to accept incoming TCP sessions on port 179 from an IP address range with a configuration command similar to bgp listen . You\u2019ll have to tie the allowed IP address range to a peer group to tell your router which parameters to use for a dynamic BGP neighbor. Use the following IP address ranges: Address range Peer group 10.0.0.0/24 IBGP sessions 172.16.42.0/24 EBGP sessions with AS 65100 Verification You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019ve installed netlab release 1.8.3 or later and use Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, or FRR on S1, S2, C1, and C2. The validation tests check: The state of the BGP session between those routers and the Hub router. Whether those routers receive the loopback IPv4 prefix from the Hub router. You can also validate your work on the Hub router: Check the state of the BGP sessions with a command similar to show ip bgp summary .

You can shut down a BGP neighbor on one of the other routers to explore how the hub router reacts to the BGP session loss. Tip You can use the netlab config command to shut down the BGP session with the Hub router if you\u2019re running Cumulus Linux, FRR, or Arista EOS on the other routers: Use netlab config disable --limit C1 1 to shut down the BGP session Use netlab config enable --limit C1 to reenable it. For example, after shutting down the BGP session with the Hub router on C1, you could observe the following BGP logging messages on the Hub router running Arista EOS: Bgp: %BGP-3-NOTIFICATION: received from neighbor 10.0.0.4 (VRF default AS 65000) 6/2 (Cease/administrative shutdown) reason: Bgp: %BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: peer 10.0.0.4 (VRF default AS 65000) old state Established event RecvNotify new state Idle However, even though the BGP log message claims the BGP neighbor is now in the Idle state, the neighbor is no longer visible in the list of BGP neighbors: hub#show ip bgp summary BGP summary information for VRF default Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000 Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance Neighbor V AS MsgRcvd MsgSent InQ OutQ Up/Down State PfxRcd PfxAcc 10.0.0.5 4 65000 1881 2210 0 0 01:33:54 Estab 1 1 172.16.42.2 4 65100 1832 2146 0 0 01:31:15 Estab 1 1 172.16.42.3 4 65100 1832 2147 0 0 01:31:15 Estab 1 1 Warning Do not use dynamic BGP neighbors if you want to use BGP operational data (for example, show command printouts or SNMP information) to find failed BGP sessions.
